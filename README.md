These are my submissions for [cssbattle.dev](https://cssbattle.dev)

A few of them are still my first attempt and haven't really been iterated on so probably have some low-hanging fruit. Several (largely the svg-based submissions) are stuck at 99.9% and would be worth more points if redone to hit 100% (plus svg is lame anyways).

Feel free to take these as starting points for your own submissions or ask questions, but I would prefer you didn't open pull requests to this repo as I'd like to avoid spoilers for myself.
